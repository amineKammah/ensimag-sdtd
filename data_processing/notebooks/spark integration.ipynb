Supposing\\na man lends you weapons, and then goes insane? Surely it cannot be just\\nto put weapons into the hands of a madman?\\n\\n(This fallacy, used by Plato, lies in not recognizing that the insanity is\\nan ‘accident’, in that it is a freak circumstance unrelated to the central\\ntopic, and readily admitted to be a special case.)\\n\\nAlmost every generalization could be objected to on the\\ngrounds that one could think of ‘accidental’ cases it did not\\ncover.
